            <p>Infinitely Tricky is a personal finance site for people who…</p>

            <p>Okay, thanks for bearing with me here – what I’d initially said was that this is a personal finance site for “people who work toward the social good.”</p>

            <p>While that’s the goal, and that’s what I really care about, it’s hard to describe what I’m doing without seeming smarmy or as though I’m pandering to a group of people who are tired of bromides about the good work they do.</p>

            <p>Someday I may find a way to talk about this blog in a way that conveys my legitimate earnestness without sounding terribly self-satisfied.</p>

            <p>Until then, here’s a general sense of what I’m going for:</p>

            <p>I’m going to write about personal finance topics relevant to those in the “social sector,” a term I’ll use to describe people who work in the non-profit world, education, healthcare and government.</p>

            <p>Does that mean I’ll talk about things like student loan forgiveness, pensions, and socially responsible investing? Yes, absolutely.</p>

            <p>In a broader sense, though, I’m interested in exploring the challenges that come with infusing one’s values into one’s work.</p>

            <p>If you’re working in the social sector, you likely have the nagging feeling you could earn more elsewhere. That feeling is tough to bear, especially given the expense of education, of buying a house or apartment, of raising kids, or of doing any of the other things we’re led to believe are prerequisites for being grownups.</p>

            <p>The most common result of this feeling is, I believe, a low-level resentment of:</p>
            
            <div class= "about-list" >

                <ul>
                <li>Your industry,</li>
                <li>Your organization</li>
                <li>Those of your friends and classmates who either stifled their sense of social responsibility when choosing a career or in whom such a sense is blissfully absent.</li>
                </ul>
            
            </div>

            <p>Another common result is for people to leave the social sector, either to go to grad school (as though that’s the answer to something) or to get a job that’s more lucrative but less interesting or less aligned with our values. We can rationalize this move by concluding a socially useful career was ultimately impossible, but a different sort of nagging feeling may emerge.</p>

            <p>Both outcomes – smoldering resentment and a life of regret amid material comfort – are less than ideal.</p>
