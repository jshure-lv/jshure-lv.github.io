<p>Infinitely Tricky is a personal finance site for people who…</p>

<p>Okay, thanks for bearing with me here – what I’d initially said was that this is a personal finance site for “people who work toward the social good.”</p>

<p>While that’s the goal, and that’s what I really care about, it’s hard to describe what I’m doing without seeming smarmy or as though I’m pandering to a group of people who are tired of bromides about the good work they do.</p>

<p>Someday I may find a way to talk about this blog in a way that conveys my legitimate earnestness without sounding terribly self-satisfied.</p>

<p>Until then, here’s a general sense of what I’m going for:</p>

<p>I’m going to write about personal finance topics relevant to those in the “social sector,” a term I’ll use to describe people who work in the non-profit world, education, healthcare and government.

<p>Does that mean I’ll talk about things like student loan forgiveness, pensions, and socially responsible investing? Yes, absolutely.

<p>In a broader sense, though, I’m interested in exploring the challenges that come with infusing one’s values into one’s work.

<p>If you’re working in the social sector, you likely have the nagging feeling you could earn more elsewhere. That feeling is tough to bear, especially given the expense of education, of buying a house or apartment, of raising kids, or of doing any of the other things we’re led to believe are prerequisites for being grownups.

<p>The most common result of this feeling is, I believe, a low-level resentment of:

<ul>
<li>Your industry,</li>
<li>Your organization</li>
<li>Those of your friends and classmates who either stifled their sense of social responsibility when choosing a career or in whom such a sense is blissfully absent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another common result is for people to leave the social sector, either to go to grad school (as though that’s the answer to something) or to get a job that’s more lucrative but less interesting or less aligned with our values. We can rationalize this move by concluding a socially useful career was ultimately impossible, but a different sort of nagging feeling may emerge.</p>

<p>Both outcomes – smoldering resentment and a life of regret amid material comfort – are less than ideal.</p>

 

Orange and Green Buildings - LondonI want to offer some tools and approaches that will help – that is, help you balance the fact of doing work that’s useful but not terribly lucrative with the expectations many of us struggle with.

That means talking about personal finance topics, sure, but I’ll also tap into the soup of anxieties, insecurities, and fears that often drive us. I’ll weigh in on the snippets of personal finance talk that appear up in books, movies, podcasts and other blogs. I’ll talk about what the personal finance industry does well and does poorly when it comes to helping with the issues we’ll talk about.

“Oh, so it sounds like you’re going to throw a bunch of things at the wall and kind of see what sticks.” Exactly.

In the meantime, I hope you’ll come away with some helpful approaches to building a financial life that supports the work you want to do. At the very least, I hope you’ll know you’re not alone in worrying about the same.
